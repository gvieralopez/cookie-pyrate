# 🏴‍☠️ Cookie Pyrate

A Python [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) template that keeps things **simple, modern, and ready to sail**.  
Powered by [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast dependency management and designed to give you a clean project structure from the start.

## ⚡ Usage

Make sure you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed.  
Then, with **just one command**, you can set sail and create your new project:

```bash
uvx cookiecutter gh:gvieralopez/cookie-pyrate
```

Follow the prompts to name your treasure (project 🏴‍☠️), and you’ll have a fresh repo scaffolded in seconds.
Next, `cd` into your new project folder and check the generated `README.md` for details.
